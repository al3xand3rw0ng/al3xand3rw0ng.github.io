        <p>I created an adapted version of the strategy based game of Flood-It with a partner. To play the game, a player must manipulate the grid of colors so that all of the cells are of the same color. Starting in the upper left corner, by clicking various colors they can change the color of that corner cell to increase the size of the area of their control. The player wins when the board is one color.</p>
        <p>In addition to fulfilling the assignment parameters, my partner and I added additional functionality to create difficulty modifications to enhance the user experience. This includes creating controls to change the board size and number of colors and adding user help documentation.</p>
        <p>A demonstration of game functionality is shown above.</p>
